REPORT MIAS - NONLINEAR IDENTIFICATION
PROCESS
	Description , data separation ---- validation , identification, simulation
FROE
Classical algorithm:
	- Slow varying process - always theta*y(t)
	- explained variance really high only with the first chosen regressor --- GOOD id, val, BAD simulation
	- Look at slides of the lecture , do some consideration
Analysis description:
	- Instead of chosing a threshold for the explained variance(because it was really high only with the first regressor)
	Run the analisys with different initial model assumption and different polynomial degrees. for each of them 
		- Pickup one regressor at a time and ananlyze the plots of the MSE on sim and validation
		- Sim and validation were always good, simulation was good only in some cases
		- Good simulation ----> Good identification adn validation
		- The higher the number of regressor, the lower the simulation error, probably because the process is non linear and the addition of 
		  nonlinear regressor was able to describe provide better result in simulation. 
		- At a certain point, especially with high degree of the polynomial expansion, the simulated process diverged 
NN
For the definition of the Neural Network, sklearn.MLPRegressor(Multi-layer Perceptron regressor) library has been used.
This model optimizes the squared-loss using LBFGS, an optimization algorithm in the family of quasi-Newton methods.
What we noticed is that starting from different initial state, the network produce different result:
	- Some initialization lead the minimization algorithm to be stucked in a Local Minima, producing bad results.
	- Other initialization lead to good result both  in validation and identification:
			-	Depending on the complexity and on the input of the network, some of them are able to produce
				really good result in terms of simulation	



NN vs FROE
	- Both enphasize the ability of the first regressor to produce accurated result in terms of prediction  -- but bad in simulation
	- The analisys done froe an a polynomial NARX suggest that the polynomial one is not the RIGHT nonlinearity of the system. 
	  In fact, result produced in term of simulation by the NN are in general more accurate.
